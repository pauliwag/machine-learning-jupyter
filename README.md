## [`finetuning-pretrained-convolutional-neural-networks-for-sarscov3-diagnosis`](finetuning-pretrained-convolutional-neural-networks-for-sarscov3-diagnosis.ipynb)
### Achievements
1. Rearchitected then retuned (on an Ottawa Hospital dataset) pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an ML model capable of optimally distinguishing patients infected with SARS-CoV-3 from patients that have pneumonia or are uninfected.

2. Evaluated the performance of the repurposed CNNs using different metrics, i.e., learning curves, confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, etc.
3. Computed the size of the best model for storage considerations.

## [`blind-prediction-and-performance-estimation-on-smartphone-signals`](blind-prediction-and-performance-estimation-on-smartphone-signals.ipynb)
### Achievements
1. Optimized and combined multiple different ML models into an ensemble that maximizes blind prediction accuracy and precision on unlabaled smartphone sensor signal data.

2. Computed ensemble KPIs via cross-validation, a confusion matrix, and precision-recall curves.
